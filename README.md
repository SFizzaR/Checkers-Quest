# ⚫ Checkers Quest ⚪

This repository contains a Checkers game implemented in C++ as part of a data structures project. The game features various components, including a title page, login page, and highscores, and it utilizes several data structures such as AVL trees, queues, stacks, linked lists, quick sort, and binary search.

## ✨Features✨
- **🎭 Title Page:** The game starts with a **stylish title screen**, setting the tone and theme for an immersive experience.  
- **📜 Main Menu:** Players can choose from the following options:  
  - **🎮 Play:** Opens the **login page** to enter player names and start the game.  
  - **🏆 Scores:** View **highscores**, stored using an **AVL tree**, showcasing player names and their achievements.  
  - **🚪 Quit:** Exit the game.  

- **🔑 Login Page:** Before starting, players **enter their names** to personalize the experience.  

- **♟️ Gameplay:** Classic **Checkers rules** with interactive features:  
  - Players take **turns moving diagonally** across the board.  
  - **👑 Pieces become queens** upon reaching the opposite end.  
  - **🟡 Player turn is highlighted** for clarity.  
  - **📊 Score calculation** based on move count—fewer moves, higher scores!  

- **🏁 Game Over Page:** Displays the **winner** and final stats:  
  - **🚪 Quit:** Exit the game.  
  - **🔄 Main Menu:** Return to the main screen.  
  - **🏅 View Highscores:** See the best performances.  

- **📈 Highscores:** The **AVL tree-powered leaderboard** ensures a fair and efficient ranking system, displaying **top players and their scores**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** C++  
- **Graphics & UI:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)  
- **Data Structures:** AVL trees, Queues, Stacks, Linked Lists, Quick Sort, and Binary Search 
- **Game Logic:** Custom algorithms following standard Checkers rules
